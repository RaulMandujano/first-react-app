## First React App - DGM 3790

I have created a first react app by my class Digital Media 3790. I used what I learned in class and learning through other Udemy tutorials. I used new generation Javascript and node.js to run the app. The data file was provided by UVU as general information we could use. I choose the Start War data because I found it funny and interested.
